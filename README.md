This project uses geospatial analytics and machine learning clustering techniques to recommend personalised student accommodation options based on location data, student preferences, and proximity to key points of interest (POIs) such as universities, transport links, and amenities.

Overview:

-Students often struggle to find accommodation that aligns with their lifestyle, commute preferences, and budget. This system provides a data-driven approach to help students discover ideal living options using geolocation clustering.

-By combining location coordinates with contextual features, we group accommodation listings into meaningful clusters—such as near-campus, nightlife-friendly, quiet residential areas, budget zones, and more.

Key Features:

1. Geospatial Clustering: Uses algorithms like K-Means, DBSCAN, or HDBSCAN to group accommodation locations.

2. Personalised Recommendations: Matches students to clusters based on commute time, amenities, lifestyle, and cost.

3. Distance & Routing Metrics: Incorporates walking/driving/public transport distance via mapping APIs.

4. Interactive Visualisation (optional): Supports plotting clusters on maps using Folium/Mapbox/Leaflet.

5. Flexible Data Inputs: Works with CSV datasets, APIs, or university accommodation databases.
